This is my Projects folder I will be keeping both finished and unfinished projects that I have finished or am currently working on here. 

First Project Calculator: I am trying to make a calculator that uses regular expresions to evaluate expresions. This is mot fully finished yet,
the calculator is able to correcly execute order of operations for a expreison like 3 + 4*2. The next step for this is to be able to evalute 
inner perethesis to solve more complex equaitons. 

Second project Car Data: This folder I orginally created to study for my data science final by practicing using pandas and SQL, but I would like 
to add onto this and create a decision tree to  predict fatal car accidents based on the csv crash data from the state of washington for 2015

Third Project Game of Life:  This was my final project for my Data mangment class in school. This was a group project where I created the main code 
for the variations of the game of life 1-3 where I printed out the graphics and created differnt rules for the game of life. The game even allows 
the user to input there own rules as well. My partner in the project created the tkinter amimation for the game. 

Fourth Project (Fantasy Football Draft Assistant)  - This Fantasy Football Draft Assistant was built in Python using CBS Sports PPR-based player projections, which I web scraped and organized into dictionaries before creating a cleaned CSV file. I utilized regular expressions to efficiently search for players and positions, allowing users to draft players for their team or mark players drafted by others. After completing the backend functionality, I developed an interactive front-end with Streamlit, enabling users to view top available players by position and track drafted players in real-time through a simple web app interface.

Fifth Project(R_files) - This project showcases work I did in school involving regression models and data analysis in R. I uploaded the PDFs, which include charts, graphs, and analysis, to demonstrate my skills in creating regression tables and analyzing data with a variety of charts and graphs.
