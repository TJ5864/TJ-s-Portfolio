The Fantasy Football Draft Assistant is a Python-based project designed to help users make smarter, data-driven draft decisions for fantasy football leagues. This tool scrapes up-to-date player projections and stats from CBS Sports using BeautifulSoup and requests, cleans and organizes the data with pandas, and provides an interactive draft interface that allows users to filter players, view detailed stats, and receive position-based recommendations optimized for PPR (Points Per Reception) scoring formats. The app integrates modular Python scripts for data cleaning, web scraping, and interactive functionality, and it leverages key programming concepts such as object-oriented design, data manipulation, and real-time decision support. During development, I learned to build efficient data pipelines, manage dependencies, and use Git and GitHub for version control. I also experimented with AI integration to enable smarter draft suggestions and laid the groundwork for a Streamlit-based web interface to make the assistant accessible online. Overall, this project strengthened my skills in Python automation, data analysis, and full-stack app development using real sports data.
